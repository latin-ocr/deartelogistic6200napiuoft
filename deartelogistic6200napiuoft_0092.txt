ter of quantity or magnitude, rather than as number or multi-
tude ; and calls them ‘⁶ nomina‚” because susceptible‚ he sayS‚
rather of being named than numbered. Moreover‚ he had con-
sidered these quantities so profoundly as to discover all their
computative propertieS, and fully to illustrate them under the
operation of all the rules of Arithmaic relative to discrete

number and quantity.

Having digested this important chapter of his system of
Logistic‚ Napier was struck with the necessity of a new nomi-
nation and notation wherewith to work, more easily and effec-
tually, the peculiar quantities in question. The ancient geo-
metrici‘ans had derived their nomination of the successive
powers of a number, entirely from the three local dimensions of
nature‚—length‚ breadth, and thickness, Napier, in his Com-
mentaries on the Revelation‚ took those co-existing qualities
as an illustration of the Trinity 3 but he was not satisfied with
their illustration of the geometrica] progression of numberS.

A geometrical progressiom of which we hear so much in all

statements of the Logarithmic principle, is so called, because ’

the successive numerica] powers which compose it were named
from the geometrical extensions—represented by a line, a
surface or square, and a solid or cube. The square contains
. two of the local dimensions,—length and breadth 3 in the cube
