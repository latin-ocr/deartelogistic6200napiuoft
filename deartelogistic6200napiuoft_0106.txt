lxxx INTRODUCTION.

Binomial Theorem‚ in the case of integral and affirmative
powers, which is of great use in the construction of Loga-
ritth.” But Napier had anticipated Pascal in this invention,
which, however, only received its most valuable algebraic
application‚ dependent as that is upon the modern exponential

notation‚ at the hands of Sir Isaac Newton.

There are other indicationS‚ in the manuscripts now sub-
mitted to the public, of an inventive genius in NumberS‚ far
before the times in which Napier wrote. Professor Ray-fair,
in his Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and
Physica] Science‚ when speaking of Albert Girard‚—a Flemish
rnathematichn, whose principal work, Invention Nouvelle en
Algebre‚ was printed in 1669‚—-observeS‚ ‘⁶ He appears to
have been the first who understood the use of negative roots in
the solution of geometrical problemS, and is the author of the
figurative expression which gives to negative quantities the name
of ⁶ quantities less than nothing‚’—-a phrase that has been severe-
ly censured by those who forget that there are correct ideas
which correct lang-uage can hardly be made to express. The
same mathematician conceived the notion of imaginary rootS‚
and showed that the number of the roots of an equation could
not exceed the exponent of the highest power of the unknown
quantity.” Sir John Leslie, who continued Playfair’s Disser-
