steps being deduced from this one, the trifling error in question
is thus carried on through the calculations. I corrected his
error, and then, adopting his own method, but abridging the
operations by our more rapid processes of developement, I
calculated the logarithm of 5000000, which is the last in
Napier’s table, and consequently that upon which all the errors
accumulate. I found for its value 6931471.808942; whereaS‚
by the modern series, it ought to be 6931471805599. Thus
the difference commences at the tenth figure. I calculated,
in like manner, the hyperbolic logarithm, with Napier's
numbers corrected, and found for its value 23025850940346,
while, by our present tables‚ it is 2.3025850929940; so
the real difference only falls on the ninth decimal. But
this is beyond the range of the tables of Callet, which are in
daily, use. If Napier had even commanded the services of
a village sehoolmaster‚ to calculate‚ by the inventor’s own
method of subtractionS‚ a geometrica] progression still slower
than what he used, a desideratum to which he himself calls
attention, the tables of Briggs, calculated to 'fourteen deci-
mals, would have possessed no superiority over those of
Napier. His minor inventions are scarcely worth mention-

ing aster this immense invention of Logarithms. That was

sufficient for the lifetime‚ as it is for the fame„ of a single

individual.”
