connected with the doctrine of Logarithms‚ unnecessary to be
considered here, showing its natural affinity to the system of the
Arabic notation‚ which in fact only became perfectly developed
when the Logarithms were invented3 and it is singular that,
among the mathematica] stores of those distant elimes from
which was derived the refined and powerful notation in question,
and throughout the long ages of its operation in the hands of
genius, not a trace can be discovered of a conception of that
development of the scale which Napier accomplished in the
Logarithms and the arithmetic of Decimal fractions. The
Chinese are said to have laid claim to the invention; but the
splendid copy of the Logarithms which issued from the imperial
press of Pekin‚ contains certain errors which have been recently

discovered in the European tables, previously published.

Napier’s mode of demonstrating the Logaritth, by the
motion of points (fluxu puncti) generating two lines—the one

‘⁴ when the point describing the same goeth forward equal
spaces in equal times or moments‚'' and the other (which,

to facilitate his operations‚ he took in the decreasing ratic,
having complete command of the arithmetic of negative
quantities‚) ‘⁶ when the point„ describing the same in equal
times», cutteth off parts continually of the same proportion

to the lines from which they are cut off‚”-was afterwards
