cient to prove that his invention of the Logarithms was sub-
sequent to such speculations 3 for the mind which accomplished
the Logaritth‚ and compounded that name for them, could
scarcely fail very soon to perceive that the radica] signS‚ expres-
sive of a surd root, were to be entirely superseded by fractional
exponents. Dr Hutton committed a strange anachronism, and
one which does injustice to the genius of Napier, in the follow-
ing passage :--“ The notation of powers and roots‚ by the pre-
sent mode of exponentS‚ has introduced a new and general
arithmetic of exponents or powers3 for hence powers are
multiplied by only adding their exponents, divided by subtract-
ing the exponentS‚ raised to other powers, or roots of them
extracted, by multiplying or dividing the exponent by the
index of the power or root. So a2><a3=a⁵‚ and a÷><a2=a÷;
a⁵÷a³=a⁹‚ and ai÷ab=m¹3 the second power of αὖ is τιὸ, and
the third root of αδ is αἳ. This algorithm of powers led
the way to the invention of Logaritth‚ which are only the
indices or exponents of powers; and hence the addition and
subtraction of Logarithms answer to the multiplication and
division of numbers, while the raising of powers and the ex-
tracting of roots is effected by multiplying the logarithm by the
index of the power, or dividing the logarithm by the index of
the root.”—Math. Dict. If the algorithm oi* which Dr Hutton
here speaks had belonged to science before Napier invented
