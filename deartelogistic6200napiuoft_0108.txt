trica, which I shall here translate. ‘⁶ Seeing, therefore, that a
surd uninome may be the root either of an abounding or of a

defective number, and that its index may be either even or odd,
from this fourfold cause it follows, that some surds are abound-
ing, some defective, some both abounding and defective, which I
term ⁶ gemina ;’ some neither abounding nor defective, which I
call ⁶ nugacia.9 The foundation of this great Algebraic secret
I have already laid in the sixth chapter of the first book 3 and,
though hitherto unrevealed by any one else, so far as I know,
the value of it to this art, and to Mathematics in general, shall

presently appear.”

There can be no doubt that by ‘⁶ nugacia” Napier means
the impossible quantity, and that he was the very first to con-
ceive the idea, and to propose its use, in the arithmetic of
surds and the theory of equationS. He explains precisely its
nature, and gives rules for its notation, and applies to it the
startling designations of “ a quantity absurd and impossible,
nonsensical and signifying nothing?² He shows that all roots,
whether abounding or defective, (or, as he also terms it,
greater or less than nothing,) when multiplied to an even index
produce an abounding radicate. Thus, take for the root
-1-2, and let it be multiplied to the index 4, (in other wordS,
raised to the fourth power,) and the radicate will be -1-16 ; in
