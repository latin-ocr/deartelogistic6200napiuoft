The third son of the Feudist was John Craig‚ afterwards
Dr John Craig, physician to James VI. 3 and he was also the
friend of John Napier‚ the son of his father’s colleague in

1116 your letter, and the book which you sent me.” The date
of this letter is not given 3 but, in the Library of the Univer-

Brahe, which beare, upon the first blank leaf, a manuscript
