INTRODUCTION. xxvii

It is interesting to compare this judgment upon N apier's
labourS‚ pronounced in the nineteenth century from the
highest tribunal of science„ with that modest ‘⁶ Admonitio '⁹
of his own, already quoted, wherein he anticipates the chance,
and deprecates the criticism, of casual errors in his unaided
calculationS. Biot tells US, that he could only discover ‘⁵‘ une
petite faute de ce genre, une tres petite faute.’' We may
assume, then, that Napier’s great invention had first occurred
to him many years before its publication. Indeed the following
details, which will serve to determine the chronology both of
the invention of Logarithms and of the treatises now submitted
to the public, afford a curicus proof that he was in possession
of the secret„ and preparing his publication of the Logaritth‚

some time before the close of the sixteenth century.

It is a remarkable fact, not generally known, that TYoHo
BRAHE obtained some hint of this boon to be conferred
upon science, twenty years before Napier's other avocationS‚
added to the tedicus labour of the calculations and his
own diffidence‚ permitted him to give his invention to the
world. Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston, the father of
the great Napier, was J ustice-Depute in the reign of Mary
of Scotland. His colleague in that office was Sir Thomas

Craig of Riccarton‚ celebrated for his work on Feudal law.
