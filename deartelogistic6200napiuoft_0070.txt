theory of equationS‚ which had received a great extension
from Tartalea and Cardan. The defect which materially

impeded the system was in notatiom the mainspring of numer-
ical science. In the year 1544, Michael Stifellius, a Lutheran
clergymam published at Nuremberg his Arithmetica Integra,
a very original Latin treatise on Arithmetic and Algebra‚
wherein he viewed numerica] quantities, and their combina-
tions‚ closely and ingeniously‚ and gave an impulse to Algebra
by improving its notation. He was the first to introduce the
signs -Ι- and -— for plus and minus, and also the character J
(derived from the letter R), to denote the radix or root.
Moreover‚ he entered systematically into the ‘consideration of
arithmetical and geometrica] progressionS‚ pointing out what
may now be termed the logarithmic properties of a correspond-
ing series of the powers of a given number, and the exponents
of those powerS„ which latter term he uses. But in this spe-
culation he had formed no conception of the possibility of
changing the infinite series of natural numbers from an arith-
metical to a geometrical progression‚ and then of generating a

corresponding arithmetical progression.

In the year 1552 appeared the first treatise upon Arith-
metic· and Algebra in the English language. Its author was

the unfortunate Robert Recorde, a mathematician of unn
