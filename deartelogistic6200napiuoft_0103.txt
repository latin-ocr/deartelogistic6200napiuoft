adopted by Sir Isaac Newton, in similar terms‚ to illustrate
his own discovery of Fluxions. The accidental circumstance,
or first idea, which may have led any great inventor into
the path of his distinction, can rarely be discovered. I have
endeavoured to illustrate Napier’s progress to the Logae
rithms through his mathematical studies now published.
Newton himself, in his treatise of the Quadrature of Curves,
announces the method that led him to his great discovery of
FluxionS. ‘⁶ I consider,” he says, ‘⁶ mathematical quantities
in this place not as consisting of very small parts, but as
described ΒΥ a continued motion. Lines are described, and
therefore gener-med, not ΒΥ the opposition of parm, but by the
continued motion of points ; superficies by the motion of lines ;
solids ΒΥ the motion of superficies3 angles ΒΥ the rotation of
the sides; portions of time ΒΥ a continual , flux3 and so in
other quantities. These geneses really take place in the nature
of things, and are daily seen in the motion of bodies. And
after this manner the ancients‚ by drawing moveable right
lines along immoveable right lines, taught the genesis of rect-
angleS. Therefore‚ considering that quantities which increase
in equal times, and by increasing are generated‚ become greater
or less according to the greater or less velocity with which they
increase and are generated, I sought a method of determining

quantities from the velocities of the motion or increments
