Recordc was ingenious and inventive‚ and is remarkable,
in the history of Algebra (which owes so much to successive
inventions in the art of notation)‚ for having added to its
characters the sign of equality. Mr Babbage had overlooked
the fact. That distinguished mathematician‚ in his history
of notation‚ observeS, “ It is a curious circumstance that the
symbol which now represents equality was first used to denote
subtractiom in which sense it was employed by Albert Girard‚
and that a word signifying equality was always used instead,
until the time of Harriot.„ The works of Girard and Harriot
did not appear until the seventeenth century was far advanced‚
and long after Napier’s death. Napier’s book of Arithmetic‚
as already shown, must be referred to a date prior to the year
1594 3 and it will presently appear that his book of Algebrais
of a date still earlier. If Mr Babbage’s observation were
historically accurate, we might claim for Napier the merit of
having hit upon this ingenious device, in his unpublished work„
a century before the time of Harriot. For, it will be observed‚
he adopts it in his chapter of equations‚ and defines it in these

ternis :—“ Betwixt the parts of an equation that are equal to
