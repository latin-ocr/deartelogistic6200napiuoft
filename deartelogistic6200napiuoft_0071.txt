doubted genius, but so little appreciated that he was allowed
to linger out his last days in the Fleet, where he was im-
prisoned for debt, and where he died about the year 1558.
His works are curious and original, but rude and puerile
in their style. They are generally in the form of a dialogue
between a Master and Scholar, and under such quaint titleS,
as ‘⁶ The Pathway to Knowledge ’'-“ The Ground of
Arts'’—“ The Castle of Knowledge”4—“ The Whetstone of
Wit.” Napier's style of communicating even his elementary
rules is clear, simple, and philosophical. His son tells us, that,
‘⁶ according to the opinion of the best judges, my dearest
father possessed, amongst other great endowments, this in
particular, that he could explicate the most difficult matter by
some sure and· easy method, and in the fewest words.” Ac-
cordingly, he never indulged in such facetiae as the following,
which occurs in Recorde's Arithmetic, a work, nevertheleSS,
of original genius :-“ Master. ⁶ Exclude number, and answer
this question—How many years old are you ?'—Scholar.
⁶ Mum. >—Master. ⁶ So that, if number want, you answer all
by mummes.' How many miles to ‚London ?'—Scholar. ⁶ A
poak full of plums.’—Master. ⁶ If number be lacking, it maketh
men dumb3 so that, to most questions, they must answer
mum. What call you the science you desire so greatly {³²—

Scholar. ⁶ Some call it Arsemetrick, and some Augrime.’—-
