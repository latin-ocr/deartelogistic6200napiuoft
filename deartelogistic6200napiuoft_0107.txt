tation‚ also comments upon Girard³s introduction of the phra÷
seology‚ ⁶ quantities greater and less than nothing,⁹ and upon,
his discovery and nomenclature of impossible'quantities. It
is remarkable that Playfair and Leslie, who have expressed
great admiration for the genius of Napier, had not looked at
or studied his published works. Napier’s command of the
arithmetic of -Ι- and —, the signs of positive and negative
quantities, (or as he more properly phrased‘ itg abundant or
abounding‚ and defective quantities7) was of great assistance
to him in realisinghis conception of Logarithms ; and, in the
first chapter of his Canon MirificuS‚· he sayS‚ (to quote from
the English translation of 1616, revised by himself9) (ἐ There-
fore we call the logarithms of the sines abounding‚ because
they are always greater than nothing⁷ and set this mark ÷ before
them„ or else none; but the logarithms which are less than
nothing we call defective or wanting, setting this mark -—
before them.'' Dr Horsley had fallen into the same mistake of
attributing the origin of this phraseology to Girard. But as
for the quantity called impossible, these authors had not the
means of knowing that Napier was the person who first disco-⁵
vered the use of it in mathematiCS‚ and that he had somewhat
exultingly recorded the fact. Having laid the foundation, (p. 19‚)
by an exposition of the arithmetic of -Ι- and — not inferior to

Euler’S‚ he makes the announcement, in his Logistica Geome-
