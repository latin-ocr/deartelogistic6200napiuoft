concerning this change in the system of Logaritth, he said
that for a long time he had been sensible of the same thing,
and had been anxious to accomplish it, but had published what

health would suffer him so to do. But, he conceived‚ the
change ought to be effected in this manner, that Ι Ο should
become the logarithm of unity, and 10‚000,000‚000 that of the
whole sine. This Ι could not but admit was by far the fittest
modification3 so, casting aside what I had already prepared,
Ι commenced under his advice to bend my mind to the calcu-
lation of these tables3 and in the following summer I again
took journey to Edinburgh, where I submitted to him the
principal part of those tables which are here published 3 and I
was ‚about to do the same even the third summer, had it pleased

God to have spared him t'o us so long.’'

appreciated‚ and whose friendship and admiration he cordially
returned. ‘⁶ I will acquaint you‚” says Lilly, in his Life and
