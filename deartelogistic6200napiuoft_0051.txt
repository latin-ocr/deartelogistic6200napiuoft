INTRODUCTION. XXV

we are informed by his son, ere Napier had compounded the
term Logarithms‚ under which denomination‚ however, they
were first published. He himself alludes to the long labour
bestowed upon his Canon, and to the interesting fact that his
operose calculations were entirely performed by himself. M.
Biot, in his review and ‘⁶ extrait ” of the Memoirs of Napier‚
published in the Journal des Savans for the year 1835, after
passing the highest encomiums upon the genius of Napier⁷s
works‚ thus speaks of the mechanical labour of the calcula-

tions :—

prodigy of laborious patience. As we reflect upon the time
and toi] it must have cost him to· calculate all those numbem,
we shudder at the chauces there were of his being cut off ere
he had realized his idea, and of its having died with him. It
has been said, and Delambre repeats the observatiom that the
last figures of his numbers are inaccurate. This is true3 but

whether the inaccuracy resulted from his method‚ or from some
error of calculation in applying it. This is what I have done3
and I have discovered an error of the kind, a very slight error3
in the last term of the second progression‚ which he forms pre-

paratory to the calculation of his tables, All the successive
