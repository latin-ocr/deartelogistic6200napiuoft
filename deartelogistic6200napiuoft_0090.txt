on, according to the quality of the index, which,'' 110 says, “ 10
determined by the number of .units composing the index.”
Thus, whether he explain the nature of a radicated quantity,
as that which a certain number reduces to simple unity by one
or more divisions, or as that which is raised to its particular
denomination by one or more multiplications of the same num-
ber into itself, he so brings unit into his statement of the invo-
lution or evolution, as at once to make manifest the meaning of
the algebraic lawn, that, although the powers of a number are
the products of 1110 successive multiplications of that number
into itself, yet every number, when thus taken as the root of

successive powers, is considered the first power of itself.

Moreover, Napier did not fail to observe, that there are
certain numbers which neither are to be obtained by the multi-
plication of any number whatever into itself, nor can be resolved
into simple unit by division by any number whatever. Thus,
the number 16 10 reduced to l by four times dividing by the
number 2. This discovers 2 as what Napier called the quadru-
partient root of 16, and 16 00 1110 quadruplicate, or fourth
power of 2. But there is no number, for instance, which by
involution will produce the number 10. The bipartient or
square root of 9 is 3, because 3 times 3 10 9; 11111 what is
