Which hint Neper taking, he desired him at his return to call
upon him again. Craig‚ after some weeks had passed, did so,
and Neper then shewed him a rude draught of what he called
Canon Mirabilis Logarithmorum. Which draught, with some
alteration& he printing in 1614, it came forthwith into the
hands of our author Briggs, and into those of Will. Oughtred‚

from whom the relation of this matter came.”

Any one at all conversant with the history of science, and
the nature of the invention of Logarithms, will at once per-
ceive‚ that, whatever foundation in fact this anecdote may
have, it is here inaccurately and ignorantly told. Longomon—
tanus was the pupil and assistant of Tycho at Uraniburg, and
a most distinguished mathematician. He, in common with
many others„ was well acquainted with a principle of numerical
progression, the extraordinary generalization of which by
Napier is that which constitutes the invention of Logaritth. >
Archimedes had first observed and speculated upon such pro-
gressions‚ but without discovering the Logarithms. It could not
possibly be, that a hint from Longomontanus had suggested
to Napier his great invention 3 for if a hint of the kind could
have urged any human intellect thus rapidly upon the concep-
tion of the Logarithms themselves, that hint had arisen in the
