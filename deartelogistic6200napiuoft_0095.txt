merely that a surd root was taken„ but what number of root it
was; and this by symbols entirely new and unappropriated.
Since his day, when roots were to be expressed by radical signs,
instead of by the number itself evolved, the expedient devised
was to retain the contracted R, as the initial of the word root,
and to place within it a small numeral, as the index of the
quality of the root. Thus 4710 expresses the cube root, or, as
Napier would have called it, the tripartient or third root, of the
number ten considered as a radicatum or power. This notae
tion‚——which‚ it will be observed, gets rid of the unwieldy
expedient of repeating the initials 42, ⁸8, and st, for square,
cube, and supersolid, and presents to the eye the number of
evolutions requisite to obtain the particular root‚—was not
invented until many years after Napier’s death. Now, the
notation to which he refers, in the sentence quoted above, was
so devised as at once to express that a root„ of that number to
which it was attached, was the quantity taken, the particular
number or index of that root, and the fact that the root was a

surd root, or concrete quantity. He took this simple combina-
tion of equal lines :QZ intersecting each other at equal

intervaIS. In the nine compartments‚ which this figure
presents„ he inserted the nine numeraIS‚—for the sake, he

says, of assisting the memory. From the natural arrange-
