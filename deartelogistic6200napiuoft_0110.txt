lxxxiv INTRODUCTION.

But it appears, that, when Napier had broken ground
upon the great field of equations, and with a vigour and com-
mand of the subject which obviously was about to anticipate
the conquests of many of his illustrious successors, he was
arr-ested in that progress by another idea. The stars were
becoming too many for Tycho and Kepler3 so he promised
them the Logaritth. His mind had already penetrated the
Arabio system in every direction. He had already orderly set
‹lown how the various operations of number and quantity gra-
dually unfold,—how the vast fabric produces itself, growth after
growth, every rule the parent of another, and the whole inti-
mately related, in all its partS, in endless generations of Num-
bers. Having traeed the genealogy of Numbers upwards from
nothing, he had taken zero as the pivot for a reciproca] scale,
and unfolded the logistic of ‘⁶ quantitates minores nihilo,” and
·‘ quantitates impossibiles et nihil significantes.” Then he had
viewed unit as broken into another infinite scale, and had
reduced to order all the operations of Arithmetic upon its
fractions. It remained to condense the vast system into greater
simplicity and power, and also to display unit as the pivot for a
reciprocal play of the Arabio scale, as he had done by zero. This
he accomplished by his invention and calculation of Logarithms. “
Moreover, in his brilliant performance of that promise to
Tycho, he first applied—before either Newton or Leibnitz—
