In France, the celebrated Ramus wrote an elementary
treatise on Arithmetic and Algebra, about the year 15603
but he left the science as he found it. Raphael Bombelli‚
whose Algebra was published at Bologna in the year 1572, 111
Italian, wrote more elaborately and profoundly, but did not
add any thing of consequence to the labours of his predecessors.
The first that can be said to have done 80, between the time
of Stifellius and of Napier‚ was Simon Stevinus of BrugeS‚
who published La Practique d’Arithmetique about the year
1582. Ηο afterwards put forth other works upon Arithmetic
and Algebra., along with a translation of some books of Dio-
phantus 3 in all of which he evinced a remarkable genius for his
subject. Algebraic notation received at his hands another of

those impulses by which it has 80 gradually reached its present
